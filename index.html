        <p>In 1814 Governor Macquarie established the Parramatta Native Institution. Its aim was to educate, train and Christianise Aboriginal children in an attempt to assimilate them into colonial society. The missionary William Shelley and his wife Elizabeth
            taught Indigenous people how to read the Bible and to learn a trade. Children had to live in the institution, and once they were sent there they were not permitted to return to their parents or to their traditional ways of life. The institution
            closed in 1823, criticised by some as being too expensive and by others for not achieving its aims. In 1819, the Sydney Gazette reported that a 14-year-old Aboriginal girl, Maria Lock (1805–1878), won first prize in an annual school examination
            ahead of 20 students from the Parramatta Native Institution and 100 non-Indigenous students.</p>

        <h2>The Aboriginal View</h2>
        <p>Over the life of the Parramatta Native Institution from January 1814 to December 1820, a total of 37 students were enrolled. Most stayed only for a short time before making their way back to their families. In September 1818 the number of children
            enrolled at the Native Institution swelled to 19; by the annual conference and feast of 1819 another three children had enrolled and by the end of 1820, 20 students were enrolled – the highest number of concurrent enrolments in the history
            of the Institution. By 1822 a more regular number of 13 children continued to be schooled at Parramatta. In August 1821 several of the children died, which produced a strong feeling among the other Aboriginal children that they should get
            away from the place. Many students fled the Institution.

        <h2>Non-Aboriginal Perspective</h2>
        <p>The entire Institute was run by Non-Aboriginal people. From the Chefs to the accountants. Aboriginal’s were used to do mundane and labour-intensive work. Most people saw this as a genuine effort to teach the natives as in America nothing like
            this had been attempted before. Later on, people would use this institute as an argument in debates on if British Colonisation was humane. This, of course, ignores the unholy amounts of murder that had happened before that. The low enrolments
            did not seem to deter Macquarie: he wrote glowingly of the School's success, including its role in conciliating Aboriginal people. Maria Lock's academic success and the celebration of the marriages of two students to eligible Aboriginal men
            (those showing European aptitude) were cited as successes for the project. The married couples were subsequently granted land along the Richmond Road and supplied with a comfortable hut and domestic fittings.

    <section id="Analysis Of Sources">
        <h2>Analysis of a primary source</h2>
        <p>Despite what I expected their arent many primary sources of the occasion or of the intitution as a whole. This is probably due to the fact that: Nobody gave a shit. It was seen as a simple solution to a problem that bothered them. Like swatting
            an annoying fly. Due to this not much was documented about it. However I was able to scrounge up the Bill for the Insitute. </p>
        <img src="Images/Bill.jpg" alt="Bill" id="BillImage">
        <p>This is a Document about the expediture of the institute. From what i can tell the final total is about &#x20A4;7119.40. All in all Nobdy Really cared about the school so their isn't much to talk about.</p>

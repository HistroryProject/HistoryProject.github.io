        <p>In 1814 Governor Macquarie established the Parramatta Native Institution. Its aim was to educate, train and Christianise Aboriginal children in an attempt to assimilate them into colonial society. The missionary William Shelley and his wife Elizabeth
            taught Indigenous people how to read the Bible and to learn a trade. Children had to live in the institution, and once they were sent there they were not permitted to return to their parents or to their traditional ways of life. The institution
            closed in 1823, criticised by some as being too expensive and by others for not achieving its aims. In 1819, the Sydney Gazette reported that a 14-year-old Aboriginal girl, Maria Lock (1805–1878), won first prize in an annual school examination
            ahead of 20 students from the Parramatta Native Institution and 100 non-Indigenous students.</p>

        <h2>The Aboriginal View</h2>
        <p>Over the life of the Parramatta Native Institution from January 1814 to December 1820, a total of 37 students were enrolled. Most stayed only for a short time before making their way back to their families. In September 1818 the number of children
            enrolled at the Native Institution swelled to 19; by the annual conference and feast of 1819 another three children had enrolled and by the end of 1820, 20 students were enrolled – the highest number of concurrent enrolments in the history
            of the Institution. By 1822 a more regular number of 13 children continued to be schooled at Parramatta. In August 1821 several of the children died, which produced a strong feeling among the other Aboriginal children that they should get
            away from the place. Many students fled the Institution.
